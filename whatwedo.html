                <h3>Trading Crude Oil And Refined Petroleum Products</h3>

                <p>
                    Baltic Alliance focuses trade on crude oil, fuel oil, and naphtha, and we trade the entire barrel.
                    Volumes are sourced
                    through our relationships with producers and refineries, and are supplied directly to the end user.
                    We build and nurture
                    strong relationships with key producers and end users to ensure continuity and fairness of sourcing
                    the resources to
                    operate in the riskiest project environments and realize economies of scale that were not available
                    to the majors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of
                    contractual obligations,
                    some of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for periods longer than
                    one year. Baltic
                    Alliance also enters into crude oil and petroleum products sales contracts where the source of the
                    products used to
                    fulfill the contract can be a combination of our own production and the spot market
                </p>

                <p>
                    The company traded over 70 million metric tons of crude oil and 65 million metric tons of petroleum
                    product in the year
                    2020. Third party trading activity represented over 50% of the company's total transactions.

                <p>
                    The transportation of Crude oil and petroleum products by rail to designated loading ports is
                    carried out in specialized
                    tank cars. High-quality sheet steel with a thickness of 8 millimeters is used for their
                    manufacturing. The tanks have
                    vapor and oil-benzene resistant internal coatings, as well as high levels of spark and electrostatic
                    safety.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Typically, oil and petroleum products are delivered in tanks with a capacity ranging from 100,000 to
                    200,000 metric
                    tons. The filling of the products is done from the top, while the unloading is done from the bottom
                    through special
                    openings. According to the regulations, every tank designated for the transportation of oil and
                    petroleum products must
                    have:
                </p>


                <p>
                    A viewing platform
                </p>

                <p>
                    Internal and external staircases
                </p>

                <p>
                    Drainage equipment
                </p>


                <p>
                    Crude oil logistics involve choosing appropriate modes of transportation, such as pipelines,
                    tankers, railcars, or
                    trucks, based on factors like distance, volume, and infrastructure availability. Efficient
                    transportation planning and
                    management help optimize costs, minimize transit times, and ensure the safe delivery of crude oil.

                <p>
                    Bulk transportation: Rail transport is well-suited for bulk transportation of oil and gas. Tank cars
                    designed
                    specifically for these commodities can carry large volumes of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons in a
                    single shipment.

                    Flexibility in routes: Rail networks offer extensive coverage, allowing for transportation to
                    various regions, including
                    remote areas where pipelines may not be available or economically feasible. This flexibility enables
                    oil and gas to
                    reach destinations that may not be easily accessible through other modes of transport.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Intermodal connectivity: Rail transport often integrates seamlessly with other modes of transport,
                    such as pipelines,
                    ships, or trucks. This intermodal connectivity facilitates the efficient movement of oil and gas
                    between different
                    transportation networks and helps optimize the overall supply chain.

                    Safety measures: Railway companies have specific safety protocols and regulations in place for the
                    transportation of
                    hazardous materials, including oil and gas. Tank cars used for oil and gas shipments are designed
                    and maintained to meet
                    stringent safety standards, reducing the risk of leaks or accidents during transit.

                </p>


                <p>
                    Reliability and scheduling: Rail transport offers reliable scheduling and adherence to timetables,
                    ensuring timely
                    delivery of oil and gas shipments. This predictability is crucial for industries that require a
                    steady and consistent
                    supply of these commodities.

                    Cost-effectiveness: Rail transport can often provide a cost-effective solution for transporting oil
                    and gas, especially
                    for medium to long distances. Compared to other modes of transport, such as trucks or air freight,
                    rail transport can
                    offer competitive rates, particularly for large-scale shipments.

                <p>
                    Most of our crude oil exports are carried out by sea because the maritime transport allows for the
                    transportation of
                    large volumes of crude oil and gas due to the significant capacity of oil tankers and gas carriers.
                    These specialized
                    vessels are designed to handle the specific requirements and volumes of these commodities. Sea
                    transportation provides
                    the company access to a wide range of global destinations. Crude oil and gas can be transported
                    across oceans and reach
                    various ports worldwide, Vvessels can be rerouted to accommodate shifts in supply and demand
                    patterns, ensuring
                    efficient delivery to different destinations and allowing for international trade and distribution.

                    Tengizchevroil joint
                    venture which includes a production license in the Tengiz field and the nearby Korolev field. The
                    joint venture is
                    producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved
                    development phases
                    progress. The third is the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands. Proved undeveloped reserves
                    reported for this field
                    are related to installation of future stages of compression. These reserves will move to proved
                    developed when the
                    additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure.
